\section{TotalView}

The debugger TotalView was pretty complicated to get started with, it
required some special setup and such, but when it did start to work then
we got a nice looking window with our code. It was pretty intuitive how
to use it with clear buttons for single stepping and running the code.
We have previously worked with the built in debugger in eclipse and
found the interface a bit more crude in TotalView, but it had similar
functionality. GDB is a debugger for C that is terminal based so
TotalView is better since it has a graphical interface. We didn\rq{}t
get TotalView to work correctly when we had problems with the
laborations but we imagine that it would have been a really helpful tool
to have when searching for bugs so if we would start over with the lab
series we would have spent some time on using TotalView from the
beginning, just to see how the program interacts on the different nodes.


\section{Tracing with ITAC}

We compiled the program using ITAC, ran it with mpirun on four nodes,
and analyzed the result with the Intel Trace Analyzer program. Overall,
this was easier to do than to get TotalView up and running. On the other
hand, it took some time to understand the user interface and how to view
information for our own groups, not just for the default ones. The user
interface does not work very well, at least not over X11, but it is
usable for shorter usage sessions.\\

From the global timeline in Figure \ref{timeline}, we can see that it
spends quite much time outside our defined groups in the beginning. This
is due to creation of particles. Communication and synchronization is
only done at the end of each timestep, and when using MPI\_Reduce() at
the end.\\

Figure \ref{time} show total time spent per group and node. Collission
check is the group that takes most time, which is understandable since
it is the most work-heavy part of the program. Communication and
synchronization takes little time compared to the rest. However, it is
quite interesting that we spend almost as much time waiting for
synchronization as we spend on sending actual data.\\

Figure \ref{count} shows a counter of the total momentum for each node,
representing the pressure. We see that the pressure is much higher on
two of our four nodes. This is understandable, since the nodes in the
end of the box has walls on three sides, and the other nodes just has
two, shorter walls.\\
